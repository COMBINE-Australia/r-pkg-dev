If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure ??. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table ??. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2019) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). "]
