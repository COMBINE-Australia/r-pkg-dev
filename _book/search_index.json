You can find out more about COMBINE at http://combine.org.au. The goal of this workshop is to explain the basics of R package development. By the end of the workshop you should have your own minimal R package that you can use to store your personal functions. The materials were written using the bookdown package (Xie 2019), which is built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). Requirements The workshop assumes that you are familar with basic R and the RStudio IDE. This includes topics such as installing packages, assigning variables and writing functions. If you are not comfortable with these you may need to complete an introductory R workshop first. R and RStudio You will need a recent version of R and RStudio. These materials were written using R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) and RStudio version 1.2.1335. You can download R from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Packages The packages used in the workshop are below with the versions used in these materials: devtools (v2.0.2) usethis (v1.5.1) roxygen2 (v6.1.1) testthat (v2.1.1) knitr (v1.23) Please make sure these packages are installed before starting the workshop. You can install them by running the following code. pkgs &lt;- c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;usethis&quot;, &quot;roxygen2&quot;, &quot;testhat&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;) install.packages(pkgs) GitHub Version control using git is very useful and should be part of your package development process but it is outside the scope of this workshop. However, uploading your package to code sharing websites such as GitHub is the easiest way to distribute it. Towards the end of the workshop is a section showing you to upload your package to GitHub using R commands (no knowledge of git necessary). If you would like to try this and donâ€™t already have a GitHub account please create one at https://github.com/join. References "],
["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure ??. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table ??. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2019) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). "]
