## About this workshop

This workshop was created by COMBINE, an association for Australian students in
bioinformatics, computational biology and related fields. You can find out
more about COMBINE at http://combine.org.au.

The goal of this workshop is to explain the basics of R package development. By
the end of the workshop you should have your own minimal R package that you can
use to store your personal functions.

The materials were written using the **bookdown** package
(https://bookdown.org/home/), which is built on top of R Markdown and **knitr**.
